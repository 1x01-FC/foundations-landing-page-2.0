                <p>The Speedmaster is often referred to as The Moonwatch, it
                    being the timepiece worn during the Apollo 11 landing. </p>
                <p>Yet
                    while two men walked on the moon, only one Speedmaster from that voyage touched down. Neil
                    Armstrong was not wearing his
                    watch on that historic moonwalk, having left it in the shuttle with Michael Collins to serve as
                    a backup to a failing
                    piece of equipment.</p>
                <p>It was Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin who took the Speedmaster to the moon, strapped over his spacesuit’s
                    wrist
                    using a wide band of Velcro. Sadly, this historic watch was lost on its way to the Smithsonian,
                    and has never been
                    recovered.</p>

    <div id="quote">The caseback is more remarkable still, showcasing a laser-etched image of a lunar footprint, while
        the normal "First
        watch worn on the Moon" line has been replaced with Armstrong's famous quote: "That's one small step for man,
        one giant
        leap for mankind"</div>
